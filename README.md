## What Is This?

*From Cell to Score* is a living curriculum for studying **cell-based composition techniques**—the art of building compelling motives, assembling them into phrases, and transforming them across movements and forms.

The curriculum is designed to accompany nine semesters of private composition instruction (specifically aligned with [Berklee Online's Music Composition degree](https://online.berklee.edu/music-degrees/undergraduate/music-composition)), but the principles and techniques are applicable to any serious composition study.

## Who Is This For?

* **Advanced adult learners** with existing theoretical knowledge seeking to deepen their compositional craft
* **Harmony-first composers** who want to develop stronger melodic and motivic thinking
* **Students of contemporary composition** interested in 20th/21st-century approaches to cell-based writing
* **Anyone following a private instruction sequence** who wants structured self-study material
* **Curious musicians** interested in how motives, gestures, and phrases generate larger musical forms

## What's Inside?

### Part I: Foundations

Core concepts that underpin the entire curriculum:
* The cellular approach to composition
* Motives, gestures, and phrases
* Transformation techniques
* Solo wind writing and the recorder
* Historical forms as contemporary scaffolding

### Part II: The Nine Semesters

Detailed guides for each semester of study, organized in three phases:

| Phase | Semesters | Focus |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **I: Solo Foundations** | 1–3 | Solo instrument, piano, small chamber |
| **II: Chamber Expansion** | 4–6 | Larger chamber, voice/text, conducting |
| **III: Orchestral Scope** | 7–9 | Large ensemble, orchestral, electroacoustic |

Each semester includes:
* Berklee course requirements
* Parallel cell-based learning objectives
* Repertoire to study
* Compositional projects
* Reflection space for notes and discoveries

### Part III: Daily Practices

Exercises and étude progressions to build compositional habits:
* The motive journal
* Constrained duration exercises
* Model imitation studies
* Weekly étude progressions

### Appendices

Reference materials including repertoire lists, technique catalogues, glossary, and bibliography.

## The Approach

### The Spiral Curriculum

Techniques are introduced, then revisited at increasing levels of complexity. A transformation technique learned in Semester 1 for solo recorder returns in Semester 4 in a chamber context, and again in Semester 7 at orchestral scale.

### Constraint as Liberation

Paradoxically, constraints liberate. By limiting pitch collections, rhythmic values, or registral range, we force creative solutions that wouldn't emerge in unlimited freedom.

### Practice Over Analysis

While analysis informs composition, this curriculum emphasizes *doing*. Every technique is immediately applied in compositional exercises.

### Timbre First

Before worrying about formal architecture, we explore the inner beauty of sound—its color, its breath, its life-power.

## Key Resources

The curriculum draws on these primary texts:

* **Jorge Variego**, *Composing with Constraints* (Oxford, 2021)
* **Arnold Schoenberg**, *Fundamentals of Musical Composition* (Faber, 1967)
* **Olivier Messiaen**, *The Technique of My Musical Language* (Leduc, 1944)
* **Vincent Persichetti**, *Twentieth Century Harmony* (Norton, 1961)
* **Michael Vetter**, *Il flauto dolce ed acerbo* (Moeck, 1969)

## A Living Document

This curriculum grows with study. Reflection sections throughout the book capture discoveries, challenges, and insights as the work progresses. The repository history is itself a record of compositional development.

---

## Origin Story

This curriculum emerged from conversations with [Claude](https://claude.ai) (Anthropic's AI assistant) while preparing for nine semesters of private composition instruction at Berklee Online. The initial prompt was simple: *help me design a self-study curriculum focused on cell-based composition techniques*. What followed was a deep exploration of motivic development, solo wind writing, historical forms, and the pedagogy of composition itself.

The book is published openly in the hope that it might help other composers on similar journeys—or inspire them to design their own curricula.
